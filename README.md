<h3> About </h3>
  EduFind is an android application which was developed as my thesis for the technological institute of Serres in Greece. 
  This application aims to help university students and students in general to find easily and without effort the book stores they are searching.
  At the beginning of each semester each student must obtain books for the semester to come. Those books are given by certain approved book stores.
  With this app every book store is difined by a specific location in the map which it uses it to display the exact location on google maps.
  Further more this app provides the ability to the book stores to manage their book supplies and thus making the whole process of book distribution to students alot easier.

<h3> Book Store </h3>
  As a book store you can create an account on this app by filling all the appropriate data needed. When and if the account has is approved
  by the admin then you can start using the app. You can add, delete or change your book supply data so that the users can search for them.
  When creating an account you will need to provide the exact location of your book store in order to be found via GPS. This process is 
  done automatically by opening your GPS phone service and pressing the GPS button next to the location data required.
